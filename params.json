The csv file that is available for download only provides daily, aggregate information.  However, wristbands are collecting a wealth of data throughout the day and night that is relayed to Jawbone UP API.\r\n\r\nUnable to find an existing solution that was understandable and appropriate for my data needs, I decided to tackle this project with Python and have recently arrived at a solution for accessing **full and detailed data** from Jawbone UP API.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, I'm working on a follow-up script for routing data from Jawbone UP API to mySQL database, stay tuned :) and please email me with your feedback, questions, or suggestions!\r\n\r\nlinks:\r\n================\r\nDocumentation: (http://joceydunn.github.io/jawbone-magic/docs/index.html)\r\n\r\nGitHub: (https://github.com/joceydunn/get_jawbone_data)\r\n\r\nCitation:","google":"UA-57667208-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
